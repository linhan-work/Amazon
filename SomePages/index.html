            With years of working experience in Asian investment banking industry, our company owner established sold
            networking in
            Chinese venture capital and private equity industry. Following the mushroom of international trade and
            industrial
            corporation between Canada and China, more small and medium business owners in Atlantic areas are looking
            for oversea
            capital to help them expand business to oversea market. Also, Chinese investors desire to distribute their
            fortune to
            safe and friendly developed countries such as Canada. Our company successfully helped some local fisherman
            obtain
            foreign capital to sell various fishery products with higher price to Chinese market. We also helped a
            local medical

            Study Tours are short-term academic programs that allow foreign students to complete an intensive course in
            overseas.
            They may include multiple stops at multiple destinations or be a more immersive experience at just one.
            Study Tours are
            usually 1-3 weeks in length and take place within semester breaks. As long-term partner with some of the
            best private
            and public high schools in China, our company is running a few study tour programs with high schools in
            British
            Columbia now. Next year we plan to launch new programs with Atlantic partners.
